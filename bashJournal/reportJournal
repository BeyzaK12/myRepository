JOURNAL APPLICATION REPORT

Purpose: To keep daily entries in a ZIP folder and to protect with a password.


Explanation:

First, users will see a calendar. In this screen, they should select a date.
After they select a date, the dialog box will ask "What do you want? Writing(yes) or Reading(no)?".
If they say "yes", there are two options:

1)If they do not have a journal, the application will create a new daily file with a date-time stamp
and it will be opened by Gedit. However, in terminal the dialog box will ask
"Please save your journal. Do you want to save your journal?". If they say "yes",
the application will create a ZIP folder that contains the daily file with a password and its name will be "journal.zip".
The daily file that in the current directory will be removed.
If they say "no"", in terminal the message will be printed "Please turn back after making a decision.".

2)If they already have a journal, the daily file will be unzipped from journal.zip and it will be opened by Gedit.
However, in terminal the dialog box will ask "Please save your journal. Do you want to save changes?".
If they say "yes", the daily file will be added into journal.zip and it will be removed from the current directory.
If they say "no"", in terminal the message will be printed "Please turn back after making a decision.".

If they say "no", again there are two options: 1) If there is a daily file, the application will ask password.
Then, it will be unzipped and be shown in terminal before it will be removed from the current directory. 2) If there is no daily file,
in terminal the message will appear "There is no journal.".


Conclusion:

Users can write daily entries, read after writing and the most important thing is their entries are going to be protected with a password.
They should just run the application!
